- it takes some time to load the workspace, understandable at some point i would either replace that text with a loading buffer or a skeleton of the workspace elements.
- the sidebar is fine i just recoment aligning the icons with its text on the same line.


For upcoming week, Mark wants us to have a link to a project which will be reviewed in the following week. So, upcoming week needs to have a project in decent shape for reviewal, which probably means either forking the group project, doing huge improvements to capstone, or going back to HeirErrBnb (which would mean adding all of that to all resume listings and electronic profiles).

Skills we need to be adding:

Vite 
TypeScript 
BootStrap / TailWind / SASS 

Kubernetes
(use) Docker
GraphQL
Redis (I think implies NoSQL)

Django
MongoDB

Ruby
Ruby on Rails

Security

Cloud (AWS*)

ML / generative AI 

Java
C#
Go
Rust
